# MLP_Classifier
MLP(Multi layer perceptron) to detect circle, sqaure, triangles.

Description
In this project I am gonna attempt making an MLP image Classfier to classify triangles, squares and triangles without using tensorflow or pytorch or anyother outside libraries.
However i will be using EJML(Efficient Java Matrix Library) for matrix operations and OpenCV to convert images to matrices.
This will also be my first ever AI/ML project.

Resources used:
1.EJML
2.OpenCV
3.Java
